			<h3><strong>Letra</strong></h3>
            <p>Ain't got no home, ain't got no shoes
                Ain't got no money, ain't got no class
                Ain't got no friends, ain't got no schooling
                Ain't got no wear, ain't got no job
                Ain't got no money, no place to stay
                Ain't got no father, ain't got no mother
                Ain't got no children, ain't got no sisters above
                Ain't got no earth, ain't got no faith
                Ain't got no touch, ain't got no god
                Ain't got no love
                Ain't got no wine, no cigarettes
                Ain't got no clothes, no country
                No class, no schooling
                No friends, no nothing
                Ain't got no god
                Ain't got one more
                Ain't got no earth, no ?
                No food, no home
                I said I ain't got no clothes
                No job, no nothing
                Ain't got long to live
                And I ain't got no love
                But what have I got?
                Let me tell ya what I've got
                That nobody's gonna take away
                I got my hair on my head
                I got my brains, I got my ears
                I got my eyes, I got my nose
                I dot my mouth, I got my smile
                I got my tongue, I got my chin
                I got my neck, I got my boobies
                I got my heart, I got my soul
                I got my back, I got my sex
                I got my arms, I got my hands
                I got my fingers, got my legs
                I got my feet, I got my toes
                I got my liver, got my blood
                Got life, I got my life</p>
